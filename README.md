# EYES PROJECT
## What's this project about?
This project is about creating a web page with two eyes that move following the mouse movement. This is a dynamic activity that gets advantage of the skills in JavaScript and CSS.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download three files:
   ·  index.html
   ·  eyes.js
   ·  styles.css
- the javascript file and css style sheet are already linked between them, and the three files must be saved in the same directory, always check it is donde like this.
- load "index.html" file in the web browser.
- move your mouse and have fun!
  
## What's next?
What I plan to work on next in this repository is trying to add more eyes, in different sizes and colors, see how they all behave at the same time when I move the mouse, or mave add a button to create random eyes, always trying to make it more dynamic.
